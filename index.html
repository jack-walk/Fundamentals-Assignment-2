			Across New York City, senior centers connect elderly residents with exercise classes, health and wellness resources, free meals, social events and more. But advocacy groups warn many face financial hurdles that put these services at risk.
		</p>

		<p>
			This year, New York City Council awarded $5 million in capital funding to city-operated older adult centers. Many centers have aged infrastructure that requires upgrade or repair — bathrooms, kitchens, heating and air conditioning systems and more, according to an Oct. 22 city council <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/press/2025/10/22/2991/">press release</a>.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Seniors are the jewels of our communities, and it’s critical that we invest in the resources and services that meet their needs,” Council Speaker Adrienne Adams said in the press release. “With New York City’s older adult population growing, and essential benefits for our seniors under attack by the Trump administration, it remains vital that our city steps up its support for our elders.”
		</p>

		<p>
			While the new city council funds mark a step toward fixing these issues, advocacy groups say problems remain due to long-term funding constraints and a complicated approval process for facility repairs. Some worry that could make it harder for the city’s senior centers to reach those in need.
		</p>

		<p>
			“These centers have been operating for a long time, and they have experienced degradation of the physical location,” said Kevin Kiprovski, director of public policy for LiveOn NY. His nonprofit advocates for policies that support seniors and the centers they depend on, according to the <a href="https://www.liveon-ny.org/aboutus">LiveOn NY website</a>.

			Many older adult centers are located in buildings owned by the New York City Housing Authority. That means they need the agency’s approval to make changes to their properties, including upgrades. Plus, getting repairs takes even longer if centers are depending on the agency to fund them, especially because NYCHA itself faces ongoing budget challenges.
		</p>

		<p>
			“Centers around the city are able to fix really long-standing problems because the council was willing to sort of take a leadership position and say that, ‘Hey, if we can't work out this capital issue, we need to have some band aid in the middle,’” Kiprovski said. “‘We can't run these programs and not give them any recourse if their physical space is falling apart.’”
		</p>

		<p>
			While the funds are useful, they are not recurring, making it possible for financial woes to resurface. That stands to affect a growing number of residents as the city’s elderly population continues to rise.
		</p>

		<p>
			New York City’s population ages 65 and older grew by almost half a million in just two decades, according to the <a href="https://www.osc.ny.gov/press/releases/2025/01/dinapoli-more-older-adults-calling-nyc-home-ever-comptrollers-report-finds">state comptroller’s office</a>. Many of these seniors rely on fixed incomes, and depend upon city services for their health and wellbeing.
		</p>

		<p>
			In its budget for the <a href="https://council.nyc.gov/budget/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/2025/04/Fiscal-2026-Preliminary-Budget-Response-FINAL.pdf">current fiscal year</a>, city council allocated $104.5 million in its baseline funding for older adult services. The council has also set aside more funding for programs that benefit seniors, like meal delivery and case management.
		</p>

		<p>
			According to the New York City Department for the Aging,  <a href="https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Social-Services/Older-Adult-Center-OAC-Activities/fzy4-e84j/about_data">more than 2,000 events</a> are scheduled for the city's older adult centers between November 2025 and April 2026. Most of them are related to exercise, education or skill development.
		</p>

		<p>
			Kiprovski said to meet rising demand, senior centers still need more financial support from the city government.

			“The crux of the matter is, these are government funded programs,” he said. “So there should be government funding if they need to repair some of these things.”</p>
